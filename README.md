This project evaluates various machine learning models to predict sales using historical transaction data, aiming to identify the most effective model for accurate forecasting. The dataset contains key features such as price per unit, quantity, profit, discount, and stock levels. Through data preparation and feature engineering, new variables like profit margin and delivery time were created, and missing values were handled. The performance of different models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting, was assessed using metrics like MAE, RMSE, and RÂ². The Gradient Boosting model emerged as the most effective for accurate sales prediction, balancing accuracy and explainability. The report provides actionable business recommendations such as optimizing pricing strategies, improving inventory planning, and leveraging seasonal trends. Future work includes incorporating external data, further hyperparameter tuning, and exploring deep learning approaches to enhance prediction accuracy.
